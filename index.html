                    <h2>About Epilepsy Surgery &amp; Infantile Spasms</h2>
                    <p>While brain surgery has been a viable option on adults for many years, it is still a relatively new option for pediatric patients suffering from various epilepsy diagnoses. Miles for Kyle is intended to raise awareness for pediatric epilepsy surgery. Proceeds and contributions will be donated to Dr. Deepak Lachwanni of the Cleveland Clinic's Pediatric Epilepsy Support Group (PESG) to support the ongoing research necessary to assist other pediatric patients and their families.</p>
                    <p>Pediatric epilepsy surgery can be used to treat a highly selected group of patients whose seizures are not controllable by standard means.</p>
                    <p>The appropriate candidate for epilepsy surgery must meet several criteria.</p>
                    <p>There are currently three major categories of epilepsy surgery: resective surgery, corpus collosotomy, and implantation of the vagus nerve stimulator.</p>
                    <p>In patients that meet the requirements for epilepsy surgery the results, in terms of seizure control, can be very positive with minimal side effects and complications.</p>

                <h3>What are Infantile Spasms?</h3>
                <p>Infantile spasm (IS) is a specific type of seizure seen in an epilepsy syndrome of infancy and early childhood. The onset is predominantly in the first year of life, typically between 3-6 months. The typical pattern of IS is a sudden bending forward and stiffening of the body, arms, and legs; although there can also be arching of the torso. Spasms tend to begin soon after arousal from sleep. Individual spasms typically last for 1 to 5 seconds and occur in clusters, ranging from 2 to 100 spasms at a time. Infants may have dozens of clusters and several hundred spasms per day. Infantile spasms usually stop by age 5, but are often replaced by other seizure types.</p>
                <h3>Is there any treatment?</h3>
                <p>Treatment with corticosteroids such as ACTH (adrenocorticotrophic hormone) and prednisone is standard, despite the risk of serious side effects. Newer antiepileptic medications, such as vigabatrin (which has recently received US FDA approval) have shown some efficacy.</p>

            <h2>Kyle's Profile</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Kyle Butt was born on June 15th, 2005. At 5 months, Kyle was diagnosed with a form of pediatric epilepsy known as Infantile Spasms. For the next 18 months, Kyle was followed closely by neurologic specialists at MGH where the recommended treatment was a combination of anti-seizure medications and the Ketogenic Diet. While this regiment did decrease Kyle's seizures, he continued to suffer cognitive and developmental delays.</p>
        <p>In February of 2007, ongoing diagnostic testing (MRI/EEG/PET Scan) revealed a focal lesion in the right rear area of his brain. This, along with continued seizure activity made Kyle a potential candidate for surgery. He was subsequently referred to the Cleveland Clinic for further evaluation and testing. As a result of this and much additional research, Kyle underwent a procedure performed by Dr. William Bingaman of the Children's Hospital at the Cleveland Clinic to remove 3 of the 4 lobes of the right side of his brain on May 17th, 2007. Since then, Kyle has had only 1 post-operative seizure, having celebrated his 3 year anniversary of being seizure-free this past May and is now without any anti-epileptic medication for the first time since he was 5 months old. Kyle's story has also been featured on Fox 25 News at <a href="http://www.myfoxboston.com/dpp/morning/familys_story_of_inspiration_092909" target="_blank">http://www.myfoxboston.com/dpp/morning/familys_story_of_inspiration_092909</a></p>
